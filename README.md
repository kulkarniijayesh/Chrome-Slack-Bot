# Chrome-Slack-Bot
This is a slack bot to interact with chrome instance running on a remote linux server.

Chrome provides a websockets connection to its DevTools and this socket connection is used to 
run simple commands on chrome.

Current problem statement for which development is in progress:
A linux box can be connected to a display and it would be awesome to play youtube videos on chrome browser of this linux box. And this would in-turn require some basic interaction with videos as well like play, pause, move to next video etc.


Work-in-progress: branch - dev1.0
